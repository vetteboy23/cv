  <p>I am a chiropractic doctor. I graduated in 2013 and practiced for 5 years. <br>
  By that time, I had become frustrated with the healthcare industry and how <br>
  difficult it is to operate a clinic profitably while serving patients how <br>
  I want to.</p>
  <p>As a result, I left clinical practice. Since that time, my focus has been <br>
  on discovering, developing, and teaching solutions that people can do in <br>
  the comfort of their home to take charge of their health and hopefully <br>
  decrease their need for in-clinic healthcare services.</p>

  <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>In December of 2019, I published "NeuroMotion: A Novel Approach
    to Movement"</li><br>
    <ul>
      <li>This defines movement as an <strong>interface</strong> between your brain
      and its environment</li>
      <li>It provides a background on various brain-based movement
      strategies</li>
      <li>There is also information about injury-free movement</li><br>
    </ul>
  <li>I plan to publish by December 2021 a fictional short story entitled, "The
    Soul of Books"</li><br>
  <li>I currently teach <a href="https://youtu.be/nWPMSfopZcA"><em>personal training</em></a> to clients via Zoom</li>
  </ul>
